## 3.3.0 - 2019-04-03

### Added

- You can now set multiple Slack channels to post to.

### Fixed

- Crane will no longer crash if a hook raises an exception during initialization.

### Changed

- Bumped Python dependency versions.

## 3.2.1 - 2018-09-07

### Fixed

- Non-existant commit SHAs now trigger limited mode as well,
  instead of just non-existant named references

### Changed

- Bumped Python dependency versions

## 3.2.0 - 2018-08-27

### Added

- Crane now has a new so-called _limited mode_,
  for the rebels amongst you.
  We made an attempt to save some work for ourselves
  and enforce the convention of only ever deploying images
  that are tagged with commit hashes.
  Then, in 3.1.0, we relaxed this restriction to allow any git reference as the tag.
  However we still kept hearing from people wanting to go around this.

  Now, in 3.2.0, with huge thanks to @chauffer for submitting this pull request,
  we are able to **disable all parts of crane that depend on information from git**.
  If there's no repo available, or the image tag is not a valid git reference,
  **crane will just skip all the hooks** code, and do a plain old Rancher upgrade.

  Let us reiterate though: avoid this whenever possible.
  We very strongly recommend the clean, pragmatic practice
  of tagging your images with the commit hash.

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Our Docker Hub image tags (and git tags)
  now follow the official images' convention of
  being written as just `1.2.3` as opposed to `v1.2.3`
- Crane now adheres to the [black](https://github.com/ambv/black/) code style
- Bumped Python dependency versions

### Fixed

- We now print a nice message instead of letting the Slack hook blow up
  when someone sets only one of its two required settings.

## 3.1.1 - 2018-07-23

### Changed

- All settings that are URLs are now normalized to have no trailing slashes.
  This fixes possibly broken links being printed in logs.
- Crane now exits with status code 1 after errors that it handled.
- Updated from Python 3.6 to 3.7
- Updated from Alpine 3.7 to 3.8
- Bumped Python dependency versions

### Fixed

- The error handling when the old services have mismatching commit hashes
  is no longer always failing.
- Some dependencies were forgotten from `setup.py`,
  making Python package based installations broken.
  This has been fixed by getting those dependencies from the requirements files,
  which are always in sync as they're used for our Docker image releases.

## 3.1.0 - 2018-03-19

### Added

- The `--new-image` option has been readded (after being removed in 3.0.0),
  and Crane now has proper support for images not tagged with a commit hash.
  Any git reference (such as branch names or git tags) can now be used,
  however we still **strongly recommend** running all images
  that get to production with a commit hash tag.

## 3.0.0 - 2018-03-16

### Added

- Crane is now able to upgrade a group of services even if they are running different images.
  Kiwi.com's internal use case for this is running some services on an image tagged
  `:abc123` and others on `:abc123-py3`. After running a Crane upgrade, they will be changed to
  `:def456` and `:def456-py3`, respectively.
  The only restriction is that the image tags need to contain the commit hash somewhere,
  separated by a non-alphanumeric character (such as `-`.)
- Checking whether the services have been upgraded will now be retried until 20
  consecutive failures are reached.
  This should help when Rancher starts acting unstable only after the upgrade has already been initiated.
- The calculated changelog is now printed to standard output before starting the upgrade,
  so you can find out you're deploying the wrong commit as early as possible.
- There's an extra sanity check making sure that all services are running the same version before the upgrade.
  This ensures that you can trust the calculated changelogs to really be the only changes released.

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking change**: Instead of the whole URL passed via `--new-image`,
  Crane now only needs the new commit hash you want to deploy (via `--new-commit`).
  The value of this option defaults to the commit SHA the GitLab CI pipeline is running for,
  so in most cases you can just remove the `--new-image` option entirely.

### Fixed

- Hooks were failing to gather and post the changelog (or anything, for that matter)
  when the old deployed commit has been removed by a force push.
  The new behavior is to admit defeat, and mention how we can't determine the changes.
- Sometimes the traceback was still printed
  even if we gracefully handled the exception with a nice error message.
- The Crane image had a few unused Python dependencies erroneously installed,
  which have now been removed.

## 2.1.0 - 2018-02-19

### Added

- Slack announcements will now include any line that starts with `cc`.
  This can be used to ping stakeholders whenever your commit gets released.
  Use it like this:

  ```
  Add some foo bar feature

  Closes #123

  cc @john.doe, @analytics (might have impact on sales)
  ```

- Datadog events now include the target environment's name in a tag.
- The Slack integration got a bunch of automated tests.

### Changed

- The Slack message received some tiny cosmetic adjustments.
- Merge commits are now filtered from the changelog posted on Slack.
- Bumped Python dependency versions

### Fixed

- Fixed a long-standing bug that caused the Slack and Datadog hooks to fail
  when the deployment switched branches,
  and a changelog couldn't be generated.
  Now at least the new latest commit will be posted (along with an explanation,)
  and no exceptions will be thrown.
- And fixed another long-standing bug,
  where releasers' names would be repeated
  every time a new job updated the Slack message,
  like so: `Releaser: @john.doe & @john.doe & @john.doe & @john.doe`
- Exceptions and tracebacks will now be printed at the correct lines,
  not at the end of all output.
- The Sentry hook won't fail anymore
  if the URL's trailing slash is missing.

## 2.0.2 - 2018-01-22

### Fixed

- Datadog hook is now functional. üò©

## 2.0.1 - 2018-01-22

### Fixed
